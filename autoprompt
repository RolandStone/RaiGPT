Develop a python openai chatbot with a json memory system and an optional view system. The chatbot should have the ability to interpret prompts from users and generate responses. It should also have a mode that allows it to execute commands and provide a detailed history of the actions it has taken. Additionally, the chatbot should have the ability to load and save its memory, have options for viewing the memory, and have options for viewing the command history. The program should be able to handle user inputs, generate responses, and log the conversation. It should also have the ability to execute commands and provide a detailed history of the actions it has taken. Additionally, it should have an option to view the command history and a mode that allows it to execute commands. Finally, the program should have a json memory system implemented as an object with keys being the conversation history and values being the conversation history. The view system should allow the user to view the conversation history in a structured way and allow the user to view the command history. The program should be made in a modular way with separate modules for each feature, making it easy to expand and enhance the functionality.
